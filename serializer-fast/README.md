Fast Wicket Serializer Project
===

A Wicket Serializer using the Fast 1.x (FST) library.

Fast Serialization reimplements Java Serialization with focus on speed, size and compatibility.

This allows the use of FST with minimal code change.

Fast 1.x is still maintained and supports JDK 6.

Wicketstuff also provides a Fast 2 serializer: wicketstuff-serializer-fast2.
